# Token Chart

- The challange was to create an UI component that displays the 7-day price chart of the $ATOM-$NTRN pair on the Astroport DEX that operates on the Neutron network.
- Was asked to submit the solution in the form of a static web page.
- Based on that, I decided to create this component using plain HTML/Javascript, with D3.js library to render the chart.
- The application is responsive and can be viewed on any device.
